# osm-xml

Simple [osm xml v0.6][osm-xml-documentation] parser.

## usage

to be written

## features missing for 1.0

- combining OSM-structs (something simple, make it easier to update existing
  elements inside map bounds)
- writing out OSM documents


### features which are nice to have

- tag "database": finding elements with tags faster / save memory on parsed
  structure as tags are just references to actual strings
